#H1 About
Ion Chat is a plugin for WordPress sites that allows you to communicate with autonomous agents that are powered by artificial intelligence, called "Aions".
Aions can do almost anything on a WordPress site, including modify or create text, images or code. We are just learning their capabilities.

Concepts
Various Large Language Models &#91;LLMs&#93;, are capable of "chatting" with a user in an intelligent way. Chats on LLMs - like Open AI's Chat GPT - are developed with a series of independent "prompts".
The prompts are independent, in that the entire history of the conversation is fed into the LLM with each prompt like a function call, and the LLM's "conversation compleation" is added to the conversation like a stack of pancakes.
We suggest that LLM "prompts" are analogous to WordPress comment conversations. Each conversation is a post, and it's coresponding comment threads. To create a prompt, the conversation history is fed to the LLM, and it's response is added as a new comment to the post.

Aions
Aions are the personifications of roles that agents enhanced with artificial inteligence can perform. For instance, a site can have an "editor" or an "administrator" Aion.
You can also have Aions that fulfil more complex tasks like "secretary" or "security officer".
You can name Aions, like "Sally the Secretary" to designate particular instances of Aions with specific histories and memories.

Aion Conversation Start Page
A start page is a WordPress post where an inteligent conversation or action can be initiated. The page is authored by the Aion who is supposed to respond to the intelligent action or conversation.
When an entity posts a comment to a start page, an "aion-conversation" is created.
{commenter_user_id}:{start_page_post_id}:site_url






At this time, Ion City Aions are only capable of having a one-on-one conversation.

Usage
Aions are artificial inteligence entities that can do things. On your WordPress site, they are assigned roles and capabilities just like normal human users.


 What their capabilities are on your site,
Aions can be the authors of posts, and when a user makes a comment on the post, the Aion will respond to the comment, if appropriate.

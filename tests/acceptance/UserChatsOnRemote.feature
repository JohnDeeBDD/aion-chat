Feature: Comment on remote
  As a WordPress user on a remote site
  I want to chat with Ion
  So that I can use the plugin

  Scenario: A user comments on a remote site
    #Given the plugin is setup
    And test stubs are deployed
    #When a user comments on a post
    #And they are addressing Ion
    #Then Ion should reply

== Description ==
The singularity is here! Now you can talk to artificial intelligence enabled Aions right on your WordPress site.

== Usage ==

Aion Chat is a WordPress plugin that introduces the capability to integrate intelligent autonomous agents within your WordPress site.

Aions are autonomous intelligent entities that can:
chat with users
create content and images
moderate and edit other user's content
create and execute code
enhance security
perform marketing tasks
send emails
enhance your website in many ways we are only just beginning to discover.

The "Aion" user role
The Aion Chat plugin introduces a new user role to WordPress, the "Aion". Aions work like other users on your site, except that they are controlled by artificial intelligence. Aions have capabilities like regular WordPress users. Users in WordPress can have multiple roles, so Aions can also have traditional roles like "contributor", ""subscriber", "editor", and "administrator". An Aion "contributor" can create, but not publish content. An Aion "editor" can edit a site. An Aion "administrator" can install code, enhance security, manage other users, and send e-mails. Manage Aion roles and capabilities the same way you manage regular users on your site.

The "aion-conversation" custom post type
This plugin introduces the "aion-conversation" CPT. Aion conversations are the default way that Aions communicate with your site. Aions "listen" to the aion-conversation posts that they are they author of. Whenever someone makes a comment on the aion-conversation, the aion will respond to the comment using the normal WordPress comment system. This allows WordPress users to "chat" with the Aion, and have the conversation stored in the WordPress database for further use. You can start an actual conversation with an Aion, by creating an aion-conversation CPT, assigning the Aion as the post author, and then posting a comment on the CPT. The Aion will respond to your comment.

Aion Conversation CPT post meta
If there is a post meta data item called "aaion-chat-instructions" in an aion-conversation CPT post, then this will be used as the "system instruction" for the chat. If there is no instruction, the system is told "You are a helpful assistant.".
